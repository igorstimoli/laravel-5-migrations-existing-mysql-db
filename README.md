CREATE LARAVEL 5 MIGRATIONS FOR EXISTING MYSQL DB

This is a simple yet useful php script I wrote for personal use and decided to share.

It's not a replacement for Xethron/migrations-generator (https://github.com/Xethron/migrations-generator) but it's a workaround waiting Xethron/migrations-generator compatibility with Laravel 5

ATTENTION!
Please note that files generated by this script MUST NOT be put directly into database/migrations folder in you projet.
Please read on for details.


Insructions

1) CONFIGURE
- Download the zip file
- Unzip into any directory in you server
- Edit the 'MigrationHelper.php' file with you DB details

2) CREATE MIGRATION FILES
- Run the script from any browser
- You should find a migration file for each table into the 'migrations' folder

3) SET LARAVEL FOR MIGRATIONS
As I said before you CANNOT put the generated files into your Laravel project otherwise composer will not keep track of them and you'll get error when executing 'php artisan migrate' command.
- Create a fresh new db for your Laravel project
- Configure you Laravel 'config/database.php' file to match the new empty db
- Open the Terminal and go to your Laravel project directory
- Run in Terminal 'php artisan make:migration create-YOUR_TABLE_NAME' (change YOUR_TABLE_NAME with the table you need to create)
- Repeat previous step for each table of your existing db
- Open you project database/migrations folder with your favorite editor
- Open each migration file created by artisan and replace the content with the content of the corresponding file generated by the 'MigrationHelper.php' script

4) READY TO GO
- Open the Terminal and go to your Laravel project directory
- Now you can run 'php artisan migrate' command and enjoy Laravel Migrations magic
